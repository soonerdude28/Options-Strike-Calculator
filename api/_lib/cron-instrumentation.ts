/**
 * withCronInstrumentation — HOF that wraps the boilerplate every cron
 * handler ends with: cronGuard preamble + Sentry tag + captureException
 * + reportCronRun + duration tracking + standardized response shape.
 *
 * The shape was extracted from a parallel-agent assessment of the 30+
 * cron handlers in `api/cron/`. ~38/49 cron handlers end with verbatim
 * variations of:
 *
 *   try { ...handler logic; await reportCronRun(name, { status, ... }); }
 *   catch (err) {
 *     Sentry.setTag('cron.job', name);
 *     Sentry.captureException(err);
 *     logger.error({ err }, '<name> error');
 *     return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal error' });
 *   }
 *
 * Adoption is staged across multiple Phase 3a sub-batches so each batch
 * stays under the 5-file budget. This module is greenfield — adoption
 * sites are NOT touched here.

//
// `Sentry.captureCheckIn()` (and `Sentry.withMonitor()` which calls it
// twice under the hood) is fire-and-forget at the SDK level. The
// completion check-in is queued, the function returns, the queue
// drain happens via the SDK's transport — and on Vercel Fluid Compute
// the runtime can kill the in-flight HTTP request before it reaches
// Sentry's wire. We tried `await Sentry.flush()` (commit 449fa949) and
// `waitUntil(Sentry.flush())` (commit e6db3d3d); both helped, neither
// reliably. Recovery check-ins only landed ~70% of the time, leaving
// monitors firing "A timeout check-in detected" issues every minute.
//
// This bypass talks to Sentry's check-in ingest endpoint directly via
// `await fetch()`. The await blocks until the HTTP response actually
// arrives — no SDK queue, no flush, no Vercel exit race. Deterministic.

  // likely Sentry's ingest edge throttles or RSTs unrecognized TLS
  // sessions under burst. Keep-alive reuse stays — but the stale-pool
  // drop it causes is no longer swallowed as a one-shot loss:
  //
  // 2026-08-26 DIAGNOSIS — the "~5% miss rate" estimate above was off
  // by an order of magnitude at fleet size. Sentry's 14-day usage stats
  // showed 103.3K cron check-ins ACCEPTED against a fleet that emits
  // ~20K/day (62 monitors, 15 every-minute pairs) — only ~7.4K/day
  // arriving, i.e. roughly TWO-THIRDS of check-in POSTs never reached
  // Sentry, with near-zero rate-limited (46) and invalid (28) counts.
  // Vercel runtime logs showed every cron handler returning 200 on
  // schedule. So the loss point was exactly here: the single fetch
  // attempt over a pooled connection that Fluid Compute let go stale
  // between check-ins, failing instantly (ECONNRESET) into a bare
  // `catch {}` — no retry, no log. The completion `ok` was lost far
  // more often than the opener, leaving monitors on "in_progress →
  // Timed Out" every minute.
  //
  // The fix is transport-level retry: when the fetch THROWS, undici has
  // already evicted the dead pooled connection, so the retry rides a
  // fresh connection and succeeds — up to 3 attempts total, with a
  // short jittered backoff between attempts. An HTTP response of ANY
  // status (including 429/5xx) is a definitive answer from Sentry's
  // edge and is never retried. Attempt 1 keeps the original 5s abort
  // timeout; retries get 2s each — worst case ~9s + backoffs vs. the

 * tail of a market-hours schedule (e.g. `* 13-21 * * 1-5`) alerts as a
 * "missed" check-in even though the skip is by design.
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTE — why an `in_progress` → `ok` PAIR, not a lone `ok`:
 *
 * Prior to 2026-06-08 this sent a single bare `ok` (no preceding
 * `in_progress`, no `check_in_id`). The Sentry "heartbeat" docs say a
 * lone `ok` is a valid way to mark a tick, BUT the production check-in
 * history for the four market-hours monitors (detect-periscope-{put,
 * call}-lottery, evaluate-round-trip, refresh-tracker-contracts) showed
 * the EDT closed-market tail (20:10–21:55 UTC) expiring to `missed`
 * EVERY DAY even though the skip-path `ok` was being POSTed. The live
 * session's own check-ins are `in_progress`→`ok(duration)` PAIRS; mixing
 * a lone unpaired heartbeat `ok` into a monitor that is otherwise driven
 * by paired check-ins did not reliably credit the tick.
 *
 * The fix that closes the gap WITHOUT relying on heartbeat semantics is
 * to make the skip path emit the SAME shape every live tick emits: an
 * `in_progress` immediately followed by a terminal `ok` carrying that
 * check-in's id and a zero duration. This is the canonical two-step
 * Sentry crons lifecycle (verified against Sentry crons docs), so Sentry
 * unambiguously marks the tick OK — there is no "did a bare heartbeat
 * count?" ambiguity. The skip is a 0-second "run" from Sentry's view.
 *
 * Both POSTs go through the direct HTTP bypass (`sentryCheckInDirect`),
 * which AWAITS the fetch — so both land before Vercel kills the runtime
 * (no SDK queue / flush race). No-op when the job has no SCHEDULE_MAP
 * entry (new cron not yet registered).
 *
 * This is an O(1) wrapper-level fix: EVERY market-hours monitor (all
 * ~27, not just the four diagnosed) that hits the cronGuard market-closed
 * skip path now satisfies its closed-tail ticks. The per-monitor ET
 * `timezone` anchoring is kept as defense-in-depth (see DST_TAIL_NOTE in
 * cron-schedules.ts) because the empirical EDT-tail `missed` flood was
 * observed against the lone-`ok` shape and the ET-narrowed monitor
 * windows are independently validated to expect ticks only during the

/**
 * Lighter-weight cron monitor wrap for handlers that can't adopt the
 * full `withCronInstrumentation` (paginated handlers, NDJSON streamers,
 * non-standard return shapes — see Phase 3 of the spec).
 *
 * Behaviour:
 *   1. Read `SCHEDULE_MAP[jobName]`. If missing OR
 *      `Sentry.captureCheckIn` is unavailable (per-test mocks), run the
 *      handler unchanged.
 *   2. Send `in_progress` check-in BEFORE the handler so missed-checkin
 *      detection fires when the function never executes.
 *   3. After the handler completes, look at `res.statusCode` to decide
 *      `ok` vs `error`. This is the deliberate trade-off: handlers that
 *      catch their own errors and respond 500 still get an `error`
 *      check-in even though no exception bubbled to the wrapper.
 *   4. If the handler throws (rare — most handlers catch internally),
 *      send `error` check-in then re-throw. The throw will surface to
 *      Vercel runtime as an unhandled rejection unless the handler does
 *      its own outer try/catch, which is consistent with the existing
 *      handler contract.
 *
 * This wrapper does NOT touch reportCronRun, the response shape, the
 * cronGuard call, or any other handler-internal concerns. It is purely
 * additive observability.
 *
