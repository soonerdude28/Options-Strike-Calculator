"""Multileg pattern matcher for UW Full Tape trades.

PUBLIC API:
    classify_trades(trades, window_seconds=90, strike_tolerance=0.05,
                    size_tolerance=0.1) -> pl.DataFrame

Adds these columns to the input DataFrame:
    inferred_structure  — one of 'vertical', 'strangle', 'risk_reversal',
                          'butterfly', 'isolated_leg'
    match_confidence    — float in [0, 1]
    is_isolated_leg     — bool (match_confidence < 0.5)
    pattern_group_id    — UUID-like string; all trades in a matched group
                          share an ID, isolated legs each get their own.

Algorithm (per ticker, per (expiry, option_type) cell, per time-batch):

    1. Sort trades by executed_at and assign a per-ticker chronological
       row index ``ridx``. Bucket each trade into a fixed time slice of
       size ``window_seconds`` (``tbk``). Any pair within the rolling
       window must lie in the same OR adjacent bucket.

    2. Process per (expiry, option_type) cell so the per-call data
       footprint is bounded. Within each cell we iterate ``tbk`` values
       in fixed-size batches (``_CELL_BATCH_BUCKETS`` buckets per batch);
       for each batch the anchor frame is the batch buckets and the
       partner frame additionally includes one overlap bucket past the
       batch's end (for the adjacent-bucket pair rule).

    3. Per batch:
       a) 2-leg same-type pairs (vertical): self-join the anchor against
          the partner frame on (tbk) for same-bucket, then a separate
          join on (tbk = tbk + 1) for adjacent-bucket. ridx_b > ridx_a
          dedups and bounds to chronologically ordered pairs.
       b) 2-leg cross-type pairs (strangle, risk_reversal): same idea
          but join calls × puts (within the matching expiry). The
          (expiry, option_type) iteration is replayed at the expiry
          level for this case so a "cell" contains both call and put.
       c) 3-leg butterfly: body-centric. For each body trade, look up
          low-wing and high-wing candidates in the body's bucket ± 1.

    4. All pairs are filtered + scored as polars expressions. Confidence
       drops by penalties for strike-spacing error (butterflies only),
       size-ratio error, and per-mid-leg penalty.

    5. Greedy non-overlapping assignment: sort candidates by descending
       confidence (leftmost-ridx tiebreak) and assign FCFS, skipping any
       candidate whose trades are already used. Inherently sequential;
       runs in Python over the candidate frame (small relative to N).

    6. Anything unmatched → ``isolated_leg``, confidence=0, unique gid.

Confidence scoring (deterministic):
    1.0 base for a clean match, minus penalties:
      - strike spacing error  → up to -0.15 (butterfly only)
      - size ratio error      → up to -0.15
      - mid-priced legs       → -0.05 per mid leg (direction less certain)

This is a PURE COMPUTATION module — no I/O. The validation runner that
reads parquet is a separate task.

Motivating analysis:
    docs/tmp/fulltape-tag-stratification-and-multileg-2026-05-07.md
    — 76% of $1M+ "whale" trades are spread legs.

Known limitation — SPY / SPXW on full-day workloads
---------------------------------------------------
On full-day Eod-Full-Tape workloads, SPY (~1.27M rows/day) is borderline
tractable (~6 min wall-clock) and SPXW (~1.33M rows/day, with ~1.09M
concentrated in a single 0DTE expiry) exceeds the 600s budget and trends
toward OOM on 8GB hardware. The bottleneck is the per-expiry cross-type
(calls × puts) join on the 0DTE expiry, where each side has ~540K rows.
Bucket-bounded size keys reduce but do not eliminate the join's
intermediate frame size.

Per-ticker guard: any ticker whose largest single ``(expiry,
option_type)`` cell exceeds ``_MAX_CELL_ROWS_PER_CLASSIFY`` is skipped —
its trades remain unclassified (null structure columns) and the matcher
emits a warning instead of crashing. This is best-effort behavior:
production callers (Lottery / Silent Boom detect crons) already treat a
null matcher result as a no-op.

Follow-ups that would unlock SPY/SPXW, in order of complexity:
  1. Streaming top-K-per-trade heap (Python-loop overhead, moderate;
     unlikely to help — bottleneck is join output size, not accumulator)
  2. Per-expiry sub-batching that drives ``_CELL_BATCH_BUCKETS`` down to
     1 on dense cells (smaller intermediate, more passes)
  3. Cython/Rust hot loop for the per-batch cross-join
  4. Different algorithm (bipartite matching / approximation)

For the Lottery / Silent Boom production use case this limitation is
acceptable — those detectors' ticker universe does not include
SPX/SPXW, and their per-alert windows (±45s) are far below the cell
density threshold.

# Size-bucket explosion cap. Partner side (B) of a 2-leg join is exploded

# size_tolerance=0.1, size=10 → 3 buckets, size=100 → 21, size=1000 →
# 201. Past a threshold the explosion factor dwarfs the selectivity
# benefit, so we cap the per-row expansion. Rows whose band exceeds the
# cap are routed onto a fallback non-size-key join path (slower
# per-pair but rare). With cap=30, partner-side expansion peaks at 30x

_SIZE_BUCKET_CAP: Final = 30

# Minimum partner-batch size for engaging the bucket-bounded join. Below

# ~2x wall-clock vs. the bare join. At NVDA/QQQ scale (~1K-10K
# rows-per-batch) the explosion's selectivity wins decisively. Crossover

# candidates per batch and OOM during cell accumulation.
# TODO: re-tune after SPY/SPXW OOM is resolved.
_PER_BATCH_PRUNE_THRESHOLD: Final = 50_000


# Cross-type cross-join pair cap. The cross-type step joins calls × puts
# within one expiry; a dense 0DTE open-burst bucket (e.g. 2,600 calls ×
# 4,400 puts ≈ 11.5M pairs, run twice for both orientations) materializes
# a multi-GB intermediate BEFORE _PER_BATCH_PRUNE_THRESHOLD (which prunes
# the join OUTPUT) can help — that transient spike × concurrency-4 OOM's
# the 24GB Classifier box at the open. When |A| × |B| exceeds this cap we
# iterate side A in row-chunks of ~(cap // |B|) and concat the per-chunk
# results, bounding the per-join intermediate to ~cap rows. A cross /
# size-band join is row-independent in A, so chunking is output-identical:
# (A1 ∪ A2) ⋈ B == (A1 ⋈ B) ∪ (A2 ⋈ B). At/under the cap the path is
# byte-for-byte the prior single-shot join (no chunking overhead). See
# docs/superpowers/specs/classifier-cross-type-subbatch-2026-06-04.md.
#
# Lowered 1M → 500K (2026-06-06): at 1M the fix stopped the *instant*
# crash but the box still OOM-restarted ~11x at the 2026-06-05 open
# (per-minute memory sampled 16.74 GB, sub-minute spikes still SIGKILL'd
# past 24 GB). Halving the cap halves the per-request intermediate; paired
# with the concurrency 4 → 2 drop in multileg_routes.py this targets a
# ~4x reduction in peak. Tunable — verify against the next open.
#
# Lowered 500K → 250K (2026-06-09): the 06-06 fix was INSUFFICIENT. Live
# Railway MEMORY_USAGE_GB peaked at 28.88 GB @ 17:29 UTC (12:29 CT) on
# 2026-06-09 — past the 24 GB host ceiling → kernel OOM, all-day crash
# loop. This is the per-minute sample; sub-minute peaks run higher. The
# per-request cross-join intermediate is the single largest live frame, so
# halving the cap again halves it. Paired with the concurrency 2 → 1 drop
# in multileg_routes.py (which serializes requests so only ONE request's
# peak is ever live), the two levers together target the concurrent peak
# AND the single-request peak. Verify against the next open's metric.

# prints in one bucket) builds a ~16M-row self-join intermediate eagerly,
# BEFORE _PER_BATCH_PRUNE_THRESHOLD can prune the output. Chunk the anchor
# side so each intermediate stays ~cap-sized; the self-join + filter is
# row-independent in the anchor frame so chunking is output-identical.
_SELF_JOIN_PAIR_CAP: Final = 250_000


# Butterfly skip threshold. A 3-leg butterfly body × low_wing × high_wing
# join is structurally O(N²) in the per-cell row count (size-constraints
# selectivity is high but the intermediate cross-product is not). For
# (expiry, option_type) cells over this size the body-wing-pair join
# can produce billions of rows in the intermediate frame, OOM'ing even
# with time-bucketing. Butterflies are ≪0.1% of trades so the
# trade-off is favourable: we trade a tiny butterfly-recall loss for
# headroom to classify SPXW/SPY/QQQ at all. Vertical / strangle /
# risk_reversal continue on these cells unaffected.
# TODO: re-tune after SPY/SPXW OOM is resolved.
_BUTTERFLY_CELL_LIMIT: Final = 30_000


# Butterfly body chunk size. The body x wing offset joins in
# _butterfly_from_batch are eager and uncapped; a dense butterfly-eligible
# cell (up to _BUTTERFLY_CELL_LIMIT rows) can build a large intermediate.
# Body rows are independent in the body-wing join, so processing bodies in

_BUTTERFLY_BODY_CHUNK: Final = 2_000


# Ticker overload threshold. Any ticker whose largest single
# (expiry, option_type) cell exceeds this row count is skipped entirely
# (trades remain unclassified with null structure columns and a warning
# is logged). The cross-type (calls × puts) join on the densest cell
# dominates per-ticker wall-clock and peak memory; past this threshold
# the cell + its mirror push the matcher past the 600s budget on 8GB
# hardware. Empirically (full-day 2026-05-15 Eod-Full-Tape, 8GB MBP):
#   - NVDA densest cell  ≈ 168K rows → ~70s total  (tractable)
#   - QQQ  densest cell  ≈ 293K rows → ~170s total (tractable)
#   - SPY  densest cell  ≈ 432K rows → ~354s total (marginal but OK)
#   - SPXW densest cell  ≈ 548K rows → timeout / OOM
# 500K leaves SPY tractable while ruling out SPXW. Lottery / Silent
# Boom detect crons send per-alert windows (±45s, single ticker, single

    (A.tbk + 1, size key) for adjacent. Caller pre-partitioned by
    (expiry, option_type) so ``key_extra`` is mostly a safety belt.

    Anchor chunking
    ---------------
    The A (anchor) side defaults to ``batch`` — the classic self-join where
    both sides are the same frame. ``_self_join_scored_chunked`` passes a
    row-slice of ``batch`` as ``anchor`` while keeping ``batch`` as the full
    partner (B) frame, so a dense cell's self-join intermediate stays
    bounded per chunk. The join + the ``ridx_b > ridx`` filter are
    row-independent in A, so chunking is output-identical:
    ``(A1 ∪ A2) ⋈ B == (A1 ⋈ B) ∪ (A2 ⋈ B)``. When ``anchor is None`` the
    A and B sides are identical and the path is byte-for-byte the prior
    single-shot self-join.

    Bucket-bounded size key
    -----------------------
    ``size_tolerance`` is pushed into the join key via a partner-side
    explosion. Each B row is replaced with N rows, where N = band width
    ``ceil(s*(1+tol)) - floor(s*(1-tol)) + 1``. The join key is
    ``key_extra + tbk + size`` on A and ``key_extra + tbk +
    _size_bucket`` on B. A pair surfaces iff A's integer size falls in
    B's band — the same set the post-join ``_size_err <= tol`` filter
    would have admitted (within band approximation; ``_size_err`` is
    still computed downstream so the size penalty fires unchanged).

    Small-batch fast path
    ---------------------
    Below ``_BUCKET_BATCH_MIN_ROWS`` partner-side rows, the bucket
    explosion's constant overhead exceeds the cartesian-product cost of
    a bare equi-join. We skip the explosion entirely and use the legacy
    no-size-key join, letting the post-join ``_size_err <= tol`` filter
    do the size gating. Empirically critical for AMZN-shaped tickers
    where most cells are small.

    Pathological-size protection
    ----------------------------
    Band width grows linearly with size (size=1000 → 201 buckets at
    tol=0.1). To prevent OOM/stall on mega-tickers, B rows with band
    width > ``_SIZE_BUCKET_CAP`` are NOT exploded — they're peeled off
    and run through the same legacy no-size-key join used by the
    fast path. On real data the overflow slice is small (size>~150
    prints are rare), so the O(N²) cost there is bounded.

    Returns one frame with A's columns and B's columns suffixed _b,
    plus ``tbk`` (A's bucket; preserved for parity, not used downstream).

    Below ``_BUCKET_BATCH_MIN_ROWS`` (measured on the partner side ``b``)
    we skip the bucket explosion entirely — at that scale the bucket
    overhead dominates the cartesian join cost it would have saved.

    ``a`` and ``b`` must share ``expiry``. Caller does the per-expiry
    grouping. ridx_b > ridx_a deduplicates within one pass. Unlike the
    self-join, the two sides are DIFFERENT (calls vs. puts) — so we do
    NOT need a second orientation: the caller invokes this helper twice
    (a=calls,b=puts AND a=puts,b=calls) to cover both directions.

    Bodies are anchored to ``_is_body`` rows; wings come from the full
    batch (bodies' bucket + 1 either side, via the batch iterator's
    ``all_buckets`` set).

    Peak memory is bounded by chunking the body anchors: the body × wing
    offset joins are eager and uncapped, so a dense butterfly-eligible cell
    (up to ``_BUTTERFLY_CELL_LIMIT`` rows) can build a large intermediate.
    When ``bodies.height`` exceeds ``_BUTTERFLY_BODY_CHUNK`` the bodies are
    sliced and each slice runs the full body×wing→filter→lo/hi→triple→score
    pipeline against the FULL wing frame; the per-slice candidate frames are
    concatenated and the single final triple-dedup runs ONCE on the
    concatenated result. Body rows are independent in the body×wing join, so
    slicing is output-identical: the triple key ``(ridx_lo, ridx_body,
    ridx_hi)`` is body-partitioned across slices (each ``ridx_body`` lives in
    exactly one slice), so no cross-slice triple duplicates can arise. The
    ±1 bucket overlap produces intra-slice duplicates (a shared wing joining
    the same body twice within one slice), which the single final
    ``.unique()`` collapses — deferred to the concatenated frame purely for
