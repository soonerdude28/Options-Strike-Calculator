/**
 * GET /api/cron/cleanup-ws-option-trades
 *
 * Daily pre-market retention sweep for `ws_option_trades`. Deletes
 * rows older than today's ET date minus 2 days, so the table holds
 * the current trading day plus one prior session as a safety margin
 * for end-of-day outcome enrichment. The user's authoritative full-
 * tape archive is stored locally and on Cloudflare R2 — the DB only
 * needs the hot working set for live features.
 *
 * Read-horizon audit (no consumer reaches further than same-day):
 *   - detect-lottery-fires, detect-silent-boom: NOW() - SCAN_WINDOW_MIN
 *   - enrich-{lottery,silent-boom}-outcomes: today's fires/alerts forward
 *   - evaluate-round-trip: fire_time + WINDOW_MIN minutes
 *   - lottery-contract-tape: UI-supplied [fromTs, toTs] for a single fire
 *   - opening-flow-signal: opening 5-minute slice
 *
 * See docs/superpowers/specs/ws-option-trades-retention-2026-05-16.md
 * for the full design and verified scale.
 *
 * Schedule: `5 12 * * 1-5` (12:05 UTC, 5 min after the
 * cleanup-ws-gex-strike-expiry cron so they don't contend for the
 * 1 CU autoscale ceiling).
 * Auth: CRON_SECRET via cronGuard. No UW key — DB-only.
 * Time gate: none (pre-market run; `marketHours: false`).
 *
 * Batching: 50k-row chunks with a 295 s wall budget. Daily
 * steady-state load is ~6M rows so the cron drains in 2-3 minutes;
 * the loop exists for the one-time post-deploy catch-up (also
 * handled by docs/tmp/ws-option-trades-cleanup-psql-2026-05-16.sh).
