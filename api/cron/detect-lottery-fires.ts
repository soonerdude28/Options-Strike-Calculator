/**
 * GET /api/cron/detect-lottery-fires
 *
 * Runs the v4 trigger detector on the rolling per-tick stream in
 * ws_option_trades for the Lottery Finder universe (~50 tickers).
 * Each qualifying fire is enriched with the per-fire discriminators
 * (RE-LOAD, cheap-call-PM, mode, flow_quad, tod) plus a macro-context
 * snapshot at fire time, then inserted into lottery_finder_fires with
 * ON CONFLICT (option_chain_id, trigger_time_ct) DO NOTHING.
 *
 * Cadence: every minute during market hours (13:30–21:00 UTC, Mon-Fri).
 * Each invocation scans the last 7 minutes of trades — wider than the
 * 5-min v4 window so a slow cron tick can still pick up a trigger that
 * landed at the front of its window. Cooldown + ON CONFLICT make
 * re-firing on the same chain idempotent.
 *
 * Macro snapshot is **display-only** (per spec Appendix A — every
 * macro-augmented selection rule UNDERPERFORMED the cheap-call-PM-only
 * baseline on total realized $ in the 15-day backtest).

 * pinning test requires for the post-loop feed-tier monitor query and the
 * response, while FIRE_RESERVE_MS covers the in-flight fire itself.
 *
 * Sized against measured production runs, not guesswork. On 2026-08-21
 * (13:30-20:00Z live session) this cron's own completion logs show runs of
 * 3.2s, 14.7s, 16.8s, 18.8s, 24.0s, 27.5s, 27.9s and 28.1s, every one of
 * them reporting `truncated: false, unevaluatedFires: 0`. With a 45s budget
 * the fire loop would have stopped admitting at 45-20=25s and truncated
 * roughly a third of those runs — deferring fires that complete fine today.
 * 50s puts the cutoff at 30s, above the observed 28.1s worst case, so normal
 * runs finish whole and only genuinely pathological ones defer.
 *
 * Checked between Pass 1 chain groups and between Pass 2 fires, so an
 * overrun is bounded by one unit of work. When it trips the run returns a
 * PARTIAL-but-valid result (status 'success', `truncated: true`,
 * `unevaluatedGroups` / `unevaluatedFires` counts, one warn log) instead
 * of Vercel killing the function with a 504 ("Task timed out after 60
 * seconds", 2026-08-19 13:48Z at the open — the serial per-fire Pass 2
 * work is what stacks up during the 8:30–9:00 CT volume spike). Fires
 * evaluated before the trip are written normally; anything after it rolls
 * to the next minute's run: the 7-min scan window re-detects the same
 * trigger, the cooldown seed (priorByChain) only covers fires that were
 * actually INSERTed, and the (option_chain_id, trigger_time_ct) unique
