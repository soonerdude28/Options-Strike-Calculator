"""HTTP server on port 8080 — health check + admin endpoints.

Serves `GET /health` for liveness/readiness monitoring plus two
token-gated admin endpoints:

  - `POST /admin/seed-archive` — one-shot seeding of the persistent
    volume from Vercel Blob. Safe to leave deployed: subsequent calls
    are cheap (SHA-based resume) and guarded by a single-flight lock in
    `archive_seeder`.
  - `POST|GET /admin/theta-backfill` — start / poll a targeted
    `(roots, date-range)` Theta EOD repair (see `theta_fetcher`).

Both share the `X-Admin-Token` vs `ARCHIVE_SEED_TOKEN` gate, and both
answer a flat 401 on EVERY rejection so the admin surface is not an
enumeration oracle — see `_reject_admin_unauthorized`.

# Theta Terminal v1.8.6 (the co-resident jar, HTTP on 127.0.0.1:25510)
# answers sequential requests reliably and drops them under a burst.
# Two failures traced to it:
#
#   * `/api/history` on Vercel fans out 5 symbols x up to 6 concurrent
#     days = ~30 simultaneous GET /theta/index/history calls. On
#     2026-08-19 18:31 UTC $VIX1D came back empty while the other four
#     roots succeeded, so the UI showed "n/a (no history)".
#   * On 2026-08-18 /api/chain returned 502 seven times, each preceded
#     by a sidecar `503 theta_unavailable` for $SPX.
#
# So bound how many requests may be inside the Terminal at once. This
# mirrors `archive_query.archive_query_slot()` with ONE deliberate
# difference: the archive slot sheds instantly (each admitted query
# costs ~500 MB of DuckDB memory, so queueing would just OOM later),
# whereas a queued Theta call costs nothing but a parked thread. The
# callers here are Vercel Functions with an 8s client timeout
# (`SIDECAR_TIMEOUT_MS` in api/_lib/market-data-adapters.ts), and they
# would much rather wait a couple of seconds for the Terminal than take
# an instant 503. The health server is a ThreadingHTTPServer (one
# thread per request — see `_QuietThreadingHTTPServer` and `start()`),
# so a blocking acquire parks only that request's own thread.
#
# 2 is deliberate: the Terminal is reliable sequentially, and 2 halves
# queue latency without bursting it. Override via env for ops tuning.
#
# Both knobs are read at import. An exception here would take the whole
# health server down (and Railway would then roll the deploy back in a
# loop), so a bad value must DEGRADE to the documented default rather
# than raise — see `_env_int` / `_env_float`. Concurrency is clamped to
# >= 1 because a cap of 0 would permanently shed every request.
