/**
 * GET /api/cron/enrich-lottery-outcomes
 *
 * Enriches lottery_finder_fires rows with realized exit policy outcomes
 * by reading the post-entry price stream from ws_option_trades. Runs
 * after market close (first tick 21:40 UTC / 5:40 PM EDT) so the full
 * day's trade data is available.
 *
 * For each unenriched fire (enriched_at IS NULL), queries ws_option_trades
 * for all prints on that option_chain after entry_time_ct, computes the
 * four exit policies plus peak metrics, and updates the fire record.
 *
 * Volume: 3.6k–5.3k fires/day since the uw-stream universe expansion. One
 * invocation loops over batches of ENRICH_BATCH_SIZE (oldest first) until
 * the candidate SELECT comes back short/empty or the ENRICH_WALL_BUDGET_MS
 * wall budget is exceeded; leftovers roll to the next 5-min run.
 *
 * Also computes realized_flow_inversion_pct using the per-minute UW REST
 * `/option-contract/{id}/intraday` tape (cached in option_intraday_nbbo)
 * combined with matched-side flow from net_flow_per_ticker_history. See
 * `api/_lib/flow-inversion.ts` for the algorithm and
 * `docs/superpowers/specs/lottery-flow-inversion-automation-2026-05-05.md`
 * for the broader Phase 2 design.
 *
 * Cadence: every 5 min from 21:40 to 23:55 UTC Mon-Fri, as TWO vercel.json
 * windows for this path (`40-59/5 21 * * 1-5`, then every 5 min over hours
 * 22-23 — a single crontab can't start at :40 in one hour and :00 in the
 * next). The first tick stays >= 21:40 UTC (the original close buffer, EST
 * and EDT). Capacity ≈ 28 runs × several hundred fires drains a day well
 * inside the 2-day ws_option_trades retention.
 *
 * Environment: CRON_SECRET, UW_API_KEY
